## Columbia in Canada
### 1904
The (US) Columbia Graphophone Co first established operations in Canada with a Toronto company known succcessively as:
* **Columbia Phonograph** 1904-1913
*  **Columbia Graphophone** 1914-1924
*  **Columbia Phonograph** 1925-3?. 

### 1912
In 1912, Columbia established a factory in Toronto for pressing records and assembling graphophones. 

### 1923
In 1923, the parent company declared bankruptcy.

### 1925
in 1925, it was reorganized as the Columbia Phonograph Co and its Canadian operation was taken over by Montreal financiers, who maintained the head office in Toronto and distribution centres in Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Montreal. **The Canadian operation did not survive the depression**.

### 1939
In 1939, CBS made a distribution deal with **Sparton Records** to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name as a Canadian licensee, presser and distributor for the Columbia line.

### 1948: Long Playing "microgroove" LP
In June 1948, Columbia introduced the **Long Playing "microgroove" LP** record format, which rotated at 33⅓ revolutions per minute.

### 1951 Black Labels
In 1951, the 12-inch series started using a black label with silver print and a GL prefix. There's no evidence that this happened in Canada.

### 1953: Red Label Silver Ring
In 1953, with number 525, Columbia switched to the more familiar red label, and started using the CL- prefix for their 12-inch albums as well as their 10-inch albums. Reissues of the GL series used a red label and the CL- prefix instead of GL. This series continued (with the addition of a stereo prefix later) until the early 1970s, when Columbia finally switched to the series they use today.

### 1954
In 1954, Columbia ended its distribution arrangement with Sparton Records and formed **Columbia Records of Canada, Ltd.** with a head office initially in Toronto and, as of 1960, in its suburb of Don Mills.  operating under this name from <mark>15 March 1954 until 08 June 1976</mark>, when it was renamed to CBS Records Canada Ltd.

In 1954, Columbia introduced its new "Walking Eye" logo. Columbia continued to use the "notes and mike" logo on record labels and even used a promo label showing both logos until the **"notes and mike" was phased out in 1958.** The original Walking Eye was tall and solid; it was modified in 1961 to the one still used today.

In April 1954, the Walking Eye appeared on the back cover of LPs. See ML 4853 for example.

In October, 1954, the Walking Eye appeared on a record label. See Harry James And His Orchestra's "One O'Clock Jump / Two O'Clock Jump"

### 1955: Six-Eye Label
In 1955, the **six-eye logo** appeared on record labels.

In March 1955, the tape reel logo appears underneath the LP logo on record covers (see ML 4966).

In summer 1955, the reel was dropped and "A High Fidelity Recording" was added above the LP logo on record covers (see ML 5035).

### 1956
In 1956, Columbia began recording in stereo but **stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958**.

In May 1956,  the Walking Eye appears on front covers with the "Lp" logo forming its "pupil" and below a similar eye-shaped logo with "360 Sound" in the center and Guaranteed High-Fidelity at the bottom.

In Fall 1956, the "360 Sound" logo switched from an eye-shaped oval to an egg-shaped oval with repeating squares in the middle.

### 1957
In early 1957, Columbia dispensed with "360 Sound" and adopted a 4-part vertical logo: Columbia in a square, followed by the Walking Eye logo, followed by the "Lp" logo, followed by "Guaranteed High-Fidelity."

By spring 1957,  Columbia moves to a more horizontal logo placement with Columbia to the left of a Walking Eye stacked above the Lp logo.

### 1958: Stereo
In September 1958, that Columbia began simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono versions of otherwise stereo recordings were discontinued in 1968.

### 1961: Small CBS
In late 1961, Columbia releases started carrying a **small "CBS" at the top of the label**. This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June 1962.

### 1962: Two-Eye Label
In June 1962, Columbia adopted the **"two eye"** label, as there were two CBS logos, one at each of the 9- o'clock and 3-o'clock positions around the label's edge. 
* The mono releases had a red label with a white "COLUMBIA" at the top bending around the top edge. Near the bottom of the label, in small black letters, was "GUARANTEED HIGH FIDELITY." 
* The stereo counterpart was similar, but the black lettering near the bottom was larger and said "360 SOUND" STEREO "360 SOUND."

### 1963: Black Arrows
In July 1963, Columbia added **two black arrows** to the stereo legend on the bottom.

### 1965: White Arrows
In August 1965, Columbia changed the black-on-red lettering near the bottom to an easier-to-read **white-on-red** label.

### 1967: Nonbreakable ends
In February 1967, the **"NONBREAKABLE"** was struck from all LP label copy.

### 1968: Compatible Stereo
In February 1968, Columbia started releasing albums in **"compatible stereo"** with no commercial mono releases. The last catalog number to have a commercial release issued in both mono and stereo was Gary Puckett & the Union Gap's _Incredible_ (Columbia CL-2915/CS-9715).

### 1970: Columbia All Around Label
In July 1970, the **"Columbia all around"** label was introduced which had "COLUMBIA" in yellow repeated around the edge of a red label. 

### 1971: Don Mills Plant
In 1971, Columbia opened the Columbia Records Pressing Plant in Don Mills which was in operation 1971-88.

### 1976: CBS Records Canada Ltd.
From 08 June 1976 until 14 December 1990, the Canadian branch of Columbia/CBS, operated as **CBS Records Canada Ltd.** (and CBS Disques Canada Ltée in French). The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for French-language recordings.

## Numbering
As far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing Ellington, issued in mono as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched. Pop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.

The Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the Patti Page album Honey Come Back. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957–58, although the prefix was now different. In July 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C for Columbia, E for Epic, H for Harmony (budget reissue line), M for Columbia Masterworks, S for movie soundtrack and original Broadway cast albums, Y for Columbia Odyssey, and Z for every other label that CBS distributed (collectively referred to as CBS Associated). The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets—or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2.[68] The first CBS album released under the new system was The Elvin Bishop Group's self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with F 30001 (the earliest Fillmore albums had the 'F' prefix, rather than a 'Z'), while the first actual Columbia release under the system was Herschel Bernardi's Show Stopper, assigned with C 30004.[69] The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to The Sesame Street Book and Record. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters (including R and V for Portrait, A and W for Special Products, L for Sony Wonder, S for Sony Classical, N for Monument, O for Chaos Recordings, and B for 550 Music), which continued until 2005.

#### Matrix
The 10-inch album series, which started in 1948, was dubbed the Lp (capital "L," lower case "p") for "long playing" record, and had matrix numbers like "Lp" 360/"Lp" 361 (quotes in original) for the 1948 10-inch album _Dinah Shore Sings_ [Columbia CL-6004]. When they started making 12-inch albums, they were called "extra long playing" with the matrix numbers a somewhat cumbersome X"Lp" 8463, for example.
