title: Silver RingThe Columbia 500 Series of 12" albums began with black labels and a GL- prefix. This lasted for the first 24 issues, or until the albums issued on May 1, 1953. When the next two albums were issued on August 31, 1953, Columbia changed to the red labels with the CL- prefix. Many, if not most, of the early black-label GL- prefix albums were reissued with the new red label.The first 24 albums issued in the 500 series originally had a GL- prefix and used a black label with silver print. Starting with 525, the label changed to red with a light gold print. Both of these labels had what is generally known as a deep groove under the gold ring about a half-inch inside the label edge. This groove was an artifact of the early pressing machines. See CL874 as an example of a release with two different labels (silver ring/six eye).See CL 707, 741, 775, 810 for red Masterworks (misprint?)
